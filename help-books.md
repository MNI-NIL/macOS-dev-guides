# üìò Implementing a macOS Help Book (macOS 15 ‚ÄúSequoia‚Äù and Later)

This guide provides a modern, real-world-tested walkthrough for implementing a native Help Book system in a macOS app, based on deep debugging and live analysis of macOS 15 (Sequoia). It includes undocumented system behaviors, cache handling, and proven best practices.

- And it lacks up-to-date official documentation for SwiftUI or sandboxed apps.
